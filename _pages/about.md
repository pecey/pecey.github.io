I am a graduate student at [Indiana University](https://www.indiana.edu/) pursuing Master's in Data Science. My interests are in the field of Artificial Intelligence, more specifically in Deep Learning, Reinforcement Learning and Continual Learning. At present, I am working with [Prof. Roni Khardon](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ymCi4oEAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) on stochastic online planning and learning.

Prior to this, I worked for a couple of years at [ThoughtWorks Technologies](https://www.thoughtworks.com/) as a software consultant.

I received by Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering from West Bengal University of Technology. For my final project, I worked under the guidance of Asst. Prof. Mousumi Bhattacharyya to develop a decentralized P2P file sharing system for LANs.
